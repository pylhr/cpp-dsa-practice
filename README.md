# C++ DSA and Language Concepts Practice

Welcome!  
This repository contains my structured practice of:

- 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++
- 🛠️ Core C++ Programming Concepts
- ✍️ Personal Notes and Learning Materials

Organized from basic to advanced topics, this project aims to strengthen my problem-solving and C++ coding skills without relying on any IDEs — built purely with command-line compilation.

## 🚀 Compilation and Execution

```bash
# Example for a DSA problem
g++ src/arrays/array_basic.cpp -o build/array_basic
./build/array_basic

# Example for a C++ concept demo
g++ src/cpp_concepts/pointers/pointer_basics.cpp -o build/pointer_basics
./build/pointer_basics
```

Alternatively, you can use `make` to build multiple files (if a Makefile is added).
